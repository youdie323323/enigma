🚀 **The first publicly available better javascript virtual machine obfuscator**

This tool allows you to run JavaScript code on a custom-built JavaScript interpreter, effectively making reverse engineering harder.  
In a nutshell, i called this as **javascript version of webassembly**.

## 📌 How It Works

Enigma VM obfuscates your javascript code by compiling it into a custom bytecode format that runs on an embedded javascript virtual machine.

### ❓ Why Enigma?

Unlike traditional obfuscators like [obfuscator.io](https://obfuscator.io/) or [js-confuser](https://js-confuser.com/), Enigma analyzes the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) and converts everything into bytecode before running it on a VM. To reverse this, one would need to create a disassembler (e.g. [shape security VM decompiler](https://github.com/g2asell2019/shape-security-decompiler-toolkit)), which is no trivial task. 

Moreover, deobfuscating the original code from the disassembled output is **extremely** challenging. Most disassemblers display the code in an assembly-like format. This means that if the code is pre-obfuscated and then compiled/executed on the Enigma VM, the difficulty of reverse engineering increases significantly. 

🔒 **AST informations that completely removed on compilation phase**
- Variable names
- Structural differences in loops
- Labels
- And much more...

That being said, overconfidence is not advisable. Please use it in moderation. There is no such thing as obfuscation that makes reverse engineering impossible. **Do not include personal information or passwords in code** that gets compiled.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
$ npm install enigma-vm
```

### Usage Example

```ts
import { obfuscate } from "enigma-vm";

(async function () {
    const input = `
      function sayHello(name) {
          console.log("Hello,", name + "!");
      }

      for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
          sayHello("Me and " + i);
      }
    `;

    const obfuscatedInput = await obfuscate(input);

    console.log(obfuscatedInput);
})();
```

## ⚙️ Options

Enigma provides customization options to control the compilation process.  
These options can be passed as the second argument to the `obfuscate` method.

### 🛠 Compile Options
These options affect how your code is compiled into bytecode:

- **`stripFunctionName` (boolean)**: Removes function names during compilation.
  - `true`: Function names will be removed (e.g., `myFunction.name → ""`).
  - `false`: Function names will be preserved (e.g., `myFunction.name → "myFunction"`).

### 🔧 Build Options
These options control the interpreter code:

- **`removeLicenseComments` (boolean)**: Determines whether license comments should be removed from the compiled code.
  - `true`: License comments will be removed.
  - `false`: License comments will be kept.

### 📌 Example Usage

```ts
const obfuscatedInput = await obfuscate(input, {
  compileOptions: {
    stripFunctionName: true,
  },
  buildOptions: {
    removeLicenseComments: false,
  },
});
```
